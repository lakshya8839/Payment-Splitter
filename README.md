# Payment Splitter

## Overview
Payment Splitter is a simple smart contract that allows for the distribution of funds among multiple recipients in equal shares. The contract ensures that payments are split fairly without requiring additional inputs upon deployment.

## Features
- **Automatic Payment Splitting:** The contract automatically divides any received funds equally among predefined recipients.
- **No Inputs at Deployment:** The contract does not require any input parameters when deployed.
- **Fixed Recipients:** The recipients are hardcoded and cannot be changed dynamically.
- **Simple Execution:** Users only need to send funds to the contract and call the `distribute` function to execute the splitting mechanism.

## Deployment
This contract is deployed on the **Edu Chain** network.
